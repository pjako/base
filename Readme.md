# Base Kit
This is my personal base-lib I use to program in C and even C++
In the future this library might change to depending on learnings or requirements I could not envision of the day when it was created.

The goal of this library to provide streamlined way to program with C and create applications.

Highlights of this lib:

+ Arena based memory management
+ Length base strings
+ Typed string formatter for C & C++
+ Various Platform abstractions
